# Cómo ayudar con AndroidAPS

## AndroidAPS operates entirely on volunteer efforts and has no paid staff.

Developers are parents, caregivers, loved ones and people with diabetes working together to development and improve a solution to a very common want. Developers donate their spare time for free, but it's a bit unfair to expect them to face additional costs to make something so amazing open source and free for all.

*To fully test a new rig developers need to have a spare phone and a spare pump as it cannot be used on a human until it is stable. Newer models need testing as they become available. Some of the money donated is needed also for the logistical costs of shipping these supplies across countries to the developers. Sometimes it's also nice to contribute towards the developers costs to leave their darkened rooms and meet each other at conferences and events to let their creative and analytical brains bounce off each other.*

## I can write code! How do I participate?

Yay! Look at the issues, ask in the gitter channel, there is always a lot to do! Pick a small task at first and do your first pull request! :)

## I know the system and can write documentation!

Great, this is a highly appreciated thing and a good way to pay it foreward!

* El canal de gitter antiguo relativo a la wiki se puede encontrar aquí: [AndroidAPSwiki/Lobby](https://gitter.im/AndroidAPSwiki/Lobby). En su lugar, ahora también puede ponerse en contacto con el equipo de documentación a través de la nueva dirección de correo electrónico: wiki@androidaps.org.
* Puede encontrar una guía sobre cómo realizar confirmaciones en el wiki inglés: [Cómo hacer un PR](../make-a-PR.md). Los demás idiomas sólo se traducen del inglés y no se pueden editar por razones de coherencia.

## I do speak multiple languages and whant to translate the app or the documentation

* If you want to translate **the app** to other languages (thank you), please use [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/androidaps).
* If you want to translate **the docs** to other languages (thank you), please use [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/androidapsdocs). 

Just sign up to CROWDIN, click your language, wait for admin authorization and go ahead!

## Are there other ways to help?

Skills needed include graphic design, UX design, translators, wiki editors or simply paying it forward by answering the simple questions in gitter & Facebook to allow developers the time and space to focus on the harder stuff.
