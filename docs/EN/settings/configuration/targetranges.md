- Set your lower target between 5-6 mmol/L (90-110 mg/dL)
:::
This allows you to set your target blood sugar range. Note that the upper target was an older feature in OpenAPS and is not used in the latest version of iAPS which completely ignores the upper target. In other words, if your range is set at 5-5.5 mmol/L, iAPS treats it as 5-5 mmol/L.

Generally, a low target between 5-6 mmol/L (90-110 mg/dL) is set by most users, or 1.5 mmol/L (30 mg/dL) above where they start feeling a low.
