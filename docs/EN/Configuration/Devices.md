# Devices

## Pump
This section allows you to select your insulin delivery system. For more information on supported pumps, see the following: link. Older Omnipod and Medtronic devices require a Rileylink to translate communication between your phone's bluetooth signals and the pump's radiocommunication.

You will also be asked during the setup to choose your insulin type, which will determine your duration of insulin action and peak activity time.

## CGM
This section allows you to choose your glucose data source. Most options are self explanatory. If you are using a Dexcom G5 or G6 sensor, it is important you change your transmitter ID in the iAPS app for it to continue receiving glucose information. For more information on compatible CGMs, please see the following: link

xDrip is not recommended with newer versions of the iAPS app.
