General CGM recommendations
*****************************

CGM hygiene
=============

Whichever CGM system you are using, if you are going to use blood based calibration, then there are some very clear rules you should apply, whether or not you are using DIY CGM software or the official apps. 

* Make sure hands and kit are clean.
* Try to calibrate when you have a series of dots with a flat arrow (15-30 minutes is usually enough)
* Avoid calibrating when glucose levels are moving up or down. 
* Do “enough” calibrations – on official apps, you will be prompted for once or twice per day checks. On DIY systems you may not be, and should be careful about continuing without calibrations.
* If it all possible, calibrate with some of your readings in a lower range (4-5mmol/l or 72-90mg/dl) and some at a slightly higher level (7-9mmol/l or 126-160mg/dl) as this provides a better range for the point/slope calibration.
