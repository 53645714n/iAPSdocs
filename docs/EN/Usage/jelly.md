# Jelly Pro - battery life optimization

<b><font color="#FF0000">Very important:</b></font> If you don't need Android 8.1 (i.e. to loop with an Accu-Check Combo) stay with android 7.0!
Very important: decide right before the first start if the Phone needs Android 8.1, e.g. to loop a combo. If not: Leave Jelly on Android 7.0! When you first use it, do not connect it to your Wlan or a mobile network. Otherwise the system will update itself and the Jelly can't be saved anymore. So skip setting up the WLAN network first. Setting up the Google account offline is the only thing that cannot be skipped.
