Export & import settings
**************************************************
When should I export settings?
==================================================
Be prepared for the unforeseen. You might change important settings by accident and have problems to undo the changes. Your phone might break or get stolen. To easily return to status you've been at, settings should be exported on a regular basis.

Best practice is to export after change of settings or completing an objective. 

Exported settings should be copied to a cloud storage or your computer. So you are prepared for loss or damage of your AAPS phone and do not have to start from zero.

On a Windows 10 computer it looks like this:

* **Note for Dana RS users:**

  * As pump connection settings are also imported AAPS on your new phone will already "know" the pump and therefore not start a bluetooth scan. Please pair new phone and pump manually.
