Automation
***************
What is Automation
===================
For the same frequent events, you might always have to change the same settings. To avoid the extra work, you can just try to automate the event if you can specify it well enough and let it do it for you automatically. I.e. when your BG is too low, you can decide to have automatically a high temp target. Or if you are at your fitness center, you get automatically a temp target.


How to use it
================

General
--------
There are some limits. The lowest glucose value is 72mg/dl. The lowest profile switch is 70 %.

**Please be careful:**

* **less than -2 means: -3 and lower (-4-,-10, etc)**
* **more than -2 means: -1 and higher (-1, 0, +10, etc)**


Condition:
------------
* Time vs.recurring time: With time you select just a single time event, with a recurring time, you select something that happens once a week.
* location: in the config builder (Automation), you can select which location service you want to use:

  * Use passive location
  * Use network location: Location of your Wifi
  * Use GPS location
  
Action
------
Preconditions: For some actions, there are automatically preconditions. I.E. if you want to get a temp target, the precondition is no existing temp target.
