Module Overview (Overview Part 1 - Modules)
****************************************************
AAPS is not just a (self-built) application, the application is a just one of serveral modules.

Necessary Modules
=====================
Phones
-------
Users are creating a [list of tested phones and watches](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZAsN6f0gv6tkgy9EBsYl0BQNhna0RDqA9QGycAqCQc/edit?usp=sharing)

You can use filters to display particular pumps or phones but please set back to view all when you've finished looking, ready for the next person to view all.

To record a phone or watch that isn't already listed in the spreadsheet then please fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvmuqLTZ7MizuFBoTyVCZXuDb__jnQawEvMYtnnT9RGY6QUw/viewform)

Any problems with the spreadsheet please email [hardware@androidaps.org](mailto:hardware@androidaps.org), any donations of phone/watch models that still need testing please email [donations@androidaps.org](mailto:hardware@androidaps.org).

It would be wonderful if anyone could add here a image with an overview of all different modules.

It sometimes takes a while until all module are together. But no worries, there are a lot of things you can do while waiting. It is NECESSARY to check and where approporiate adapt basal rates (BR), insulin-carbration (IC), insulin-sensitivity-factores (ISF), etc. And if already possible, open loop is a good way to test the system.

If you have your AAPS components all together (congrats!) or at least enough to start with an open loop, you should first read through the `Objectiv description <../../Usage/Objectives.html>`_ (Overview Part 2 )before each new Objectiv.
