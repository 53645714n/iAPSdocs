It would be wonderful if anyone could add here a image with an overview of all different modules.

It sometimes takes a while until all module are together. But no worries, there are a lot of things you can do while waiting. It is NECESSARY to check and where approporiate adapt basal rates (BR), insulin-carbration (IC), insulin-sensitivity-factores (ISF), etc. And if already possible, open loop is a good way to test the system.

If you have your AAPS components all together (congrats!) or at least enough to start with an open loop, you should first read through the `Objectiv description <../../Usage/Objectives.html>`_ (Overview Part 2 )before each new Objectiv.
