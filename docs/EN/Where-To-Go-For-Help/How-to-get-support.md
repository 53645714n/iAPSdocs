# How to get support

__Level 1:__ Wiki - we now have a search function!

__Level 2:__ [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AndroidAPSUsers/) OR [gitter](https://gitter.im/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS)

__Level 3:__ Gitter (if FB did not get results, wait at least a couple of hours (plural)!!! Direct crossposts will be ignored/deleted on both channels!!!)

__Level 4:__ Create an issue with logs and time of the issue

__Level 5:__ PM (only if personal data is involved that should not go in a public channel)
