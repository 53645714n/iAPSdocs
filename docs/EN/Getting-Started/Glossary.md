But if blood glucose is rising then it will only increase basal if the IOB is negative (from a previous LGS), otherwise basal rates will remain the same as your selected profile. You may temporarily experience spikes following treated hypos without the ability to increase basal on the rebound.                                    | objective 6                     |                                           |
