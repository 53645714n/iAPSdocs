You can remove the pump while taking a shower or bath. For this short period of time you'll usually won't need it. But you should tell it AAPS  so that the IOB calculations are right. Push on the light blue field "Open loop / Closed loop" on top of the homescreen. Select "Disconnect pump for 1 h". Once you have been reconnected your pump you have to select "Continue" in the same field.
