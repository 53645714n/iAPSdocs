===================
This is just a short overview of all compatible CGMs/FGM with AndroidAPS. For further details, look  `here <./Configuration/BG-Source.md>`. Just a shoort hint: if you an display your gluose data in xDrip+ or Nightscout, you can have xDrip+ has BG Source in AAPS
 

* Dexcom G4: These sensors are quite old, but you can find instructions on how to use it with xDrip+ 
* Dexcom G5: It works with xDrip+ or patched Dexcom App 
* Dexcom G6: It works with xDrip+ or patched Dexcom App 
* Libre 1: You need a transmitter for it (built or buy it yourself) and xDrip+ 
* Libre 2: There are instructions in the Internet on how to use it with xDrip+ (and no transmitter)
* Eversense: It works so far only together with ESEL and a patched Eversense-App (works not with (and only with all three components): Dana RS, LineageOS) 
* Enlite: quite complicated with a lot of extra stuff
