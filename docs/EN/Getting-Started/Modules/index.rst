It sometimes takes a while until all module are together. But no worries, there are a lot of things you can do while waiting. It is NECESSARY to check and adapt basalrates, insulin-carbration (IC), insulin-sensitivity-factores (ISF), etc. And if already possible, open loop is a good way to test the system.
